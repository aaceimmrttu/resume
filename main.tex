%	\ {Dear Hiring Manager,
%
%	I am excited to apply for the DevSecOps position at your organization. With extensive experience in systems engineering, site reliability, and security, I am confident in my ability to effectively manage multiple responsibilities and collaborate with cross-functional teams to meet project goals.
%
%	In my current role as a DevOps Engineer at C2IMERA, I have successfully implemented an API gateway rollout strategy to enable secure communication between microservices and migrated over 1200 locally run tests onto AWS, significantly improving software development efficiency. I have also proactively collaborated with security teams to implement and maintain best practices for securing cloud-based infrastructure and applications, including multi-factor authentication and encryption protocols.
%
%	As a Life Long Learner and Eagle Scout, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. I am proficient in various programming languages, development tools, database technologies, operating systems, and cloud technologies, including Java, Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server 2003/2008, AWS S3, EC2, CloudFormation, and Terraform.
%
%	At AIMES, Leidos Inc. and Insite, Crown Equipment, I developed a comprehensive DevOps framework, setup and managed a private PKI signing service, designed and established a centralized repository structure using Artifactory and Nexus, and created and maintained fully automated CI/CD pipelines for code deployment using Docker, Jenkins, AWS, and Vsphere.
%
%	I hold several certifications, including CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, and AWS SysOps, and am experienced in designing and executing end-to-end build and deployment strategies for Git branches.
%
%	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.
%
%	Sincerely,
%	Matthew Maurice}
